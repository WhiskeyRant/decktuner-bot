.: Process :.

1) 
    -- user types !help in #help to get started
    // no changes to db
2) 
    -- bot pings user in #help channel to confirm that the questionnaire has started and then tells them to check their pm's
    -- bot pm's user initiating the questionnaire
    // no changes to db
3)
    -- for each question, the bot will send a message to the user asking a question awaiting a response
        -- validation
    -- after the user finishes answering each question, the user will be presented a preview of the tuning-board message before confirming
4)
    -- the bot will confirm that the post has been created in pm
    -- a new post will be made in #tuning-board
    -- the bot will create a new channel under the Workshops category
        -- the channel will start by posting the tuning-board post, pinging it, and telling the user to be patient while tuners come and help
    // db createUser
    // db createWorkshop
5)
    -- for each tuner that participates in the channel, their name will be automatically be added to the original post in #tuning-board
    // db addTunerToWorkshop
6)
    -- after the tuning is complete, a tuner or moderator can close the channel by typing !close or by clicking the button under the first message
    // db deleteWorkshop
7)
    -- the user will be pm'd to ask for feedback
    -- a post will be made in #history channel that dictates details on the tuners and pilot
8)
    -- for each tuner that was present during the session, they will be asked to give positive or negative feedback 1 by 1 using discord buttons
        -- if they give negative feedback they will be asked to give a reason
    -- a post will be made in #history channel for each positive feedback, as well as negative feedback + reason attached
    // db updateFeedbackForUser


.: Directions :.

-- Never manually delete a workshop channel. Use !close command to close a workshop
    -- If you manually delete a workshop channel, it will not be removed from the database, resulting in stale unused data
-- Some role names cannot change
    -- The name of these roles are important to the bots functionality and cannot change (case insensitive)
    -- If you would like to change the name of these roles, the code must be edited to reflect the changes
    -- Note however that you may delete the roles or edit them
    -- Tuner
    -- Moderator
    -- Admin
-- Permissions conflicts
    -- Allowing any members to create roles means they will be able to create a role named "Tuner", "Moderator", or "Admin" which means they will be able to close workshops prematurely
-- Do not close a workshop until the pilot is ready to process feedback
    -- This might need to be an added feature to the bot. 

.: Known Issues :.

-- if you spam messages in pm, bot will forbid you from working. need to create a !close/!cancel command in channel
    -- the bot will eventually cancel but its still not good

.: Test Cases :.

.: Recent Changes :.
-- Added the ability for the designated pilot of a workshop to close their own channel. Tuners/moderators/admins can still close channels, but make sure the pilot is available to answer feedback immediately.
-- Added a thank you message when users finish answering feedback when closing a workshop.
-- Question prompt for budget category changed to be more descriptive. 
-- Posts in #tuning-board will now be removed once the workshop is closed. (Old posts remain for now.)
-- When completing the questionnaire to open a workshop, the final message will include directions for how to find the workshop channel.
